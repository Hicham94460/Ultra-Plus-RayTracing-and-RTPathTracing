For the latest instructions please see the mod Description page:

1. Delete old versions of Ultra+

2. Choose one GPU VRAM INI file. This forces a lower (for 8GB cards) or higher (for 12GB+ cards) streaming persistency cache to hopefully help with stutters in high-detail areas like Dogtown

3. Choose one Ultra+ INI file

4. Copy those files to Cyberpunk 2077\engine\config\platform\pc

5. Update DLSS (see inside the DLSS folder for instructions). the other DLLs, DLSSD (denoiser), and DLSSG (frame gen) are less important


*** The general performance suggestions on my Hogwarts Ultra+ mod here https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/mods/660 under "Detailed How-Use Instructions" also apply to Cyberpunk and most games.
