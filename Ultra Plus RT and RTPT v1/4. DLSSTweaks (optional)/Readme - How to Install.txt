All this DLSSTweaks does is forces Profile C.

I've only done limited testing, and it looks like Cyberpunk is using Profile C, but I think I'm getting a more
stable image by forcing Profile C. As I say... Very limited testing, but it doesn't hurt to do this step.

To install DLSS Tweaks for Cyberpunk 2077:
1. Download the mod from https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/550 (do not use the Cyberpunk specific version)
2. Rename the DLL to dxgi.dll. (I've found leaving it as nvngx.dll breaks path tracing. If you are using Reshade, rename the DLSSTweaks DLL to xinput9_1_0.dll)
2. Go to your C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64 folder (or GoG folder)
3. Copy dxgi.dll or xinput9_1_0.dll here from DLSSTweaks
4. Copy the dlsstweaks.ini I've provided here as well
5. That's it! Enjoy a more stable image (I think?)! üòä
